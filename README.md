This project is a basic calculator built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript internally, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks. It is designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


Key Features:

User Interface (UI) created with HTML to structure the calculator layout (buttons, display, etc.).

Styling and responsive design handled through CSS, giving the calculator a clean and modern appearance.

Functionality implemented using JavaScript, allowing real-time input processing and result calculation.

Interactive buttons for digits (0–9), decimal point, operators (+, –, ×, ÷), and controls like Clear (C) and Equal (=).

Instant display updates based on user input and operations.


How It Works ?

The user clicks the number and operator buttons to build an arithmetic expression.

JavaScript captures the input and evaluates the expression when the equal sign is pressed.

The result is displayed in the input/output screen at the top of the calculator.
